# Turboencabulator

The original package had a base case of predeterministic algorithms, surmounted by a multiphasic logarithmic downcasing in such a way that the two main singleton buffers were in a direct line with the distributed proof-of-work functions. The latter consisted simply of six machine-learned map-models, so fitted to the algorithmic leftpad weakmaps that side loading was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal liminally-deterministic type placed in predeterministic semi-blockchain props in the salutator, every seventh class being connected by a nonreversible trie pipe to the differential generator on the "up" end of the grammar model.
