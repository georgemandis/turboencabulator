The original package had a base case of predeterministic algorithms, surmounted by a multiphasic logarithmic downcasing in such a way that the two main singleton buffers were in a direct line with the distributed proof-of-work functions. The latter consisted simply of six machine-learned map-models, so fitted to the algorithmic leftpad weakmaps that side loading was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal liminally-deterministic type placed in predeterministic semi-blockchain props in the salutator, every seventh class being connected by a nonreversible trie pipe to the differential generator on the "up" end of the grammar model.

## Installation

As the description suggests, installation is easy:

```
# npm
npm install turboencabulator

# yarn
yarn add turboencabulator
```

## How to Use

Initialize it in your script like so (ESM modules):

```js
import turboencabulator from "turboencabulator";
```

Or like so (CommonJS):

```js
require("turboencabulator")
```

That should do it. Check the console logs to make sure it's initiated.
